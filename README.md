# debian-slim docker image

This repository contains a Dockerfile for building a super slim Debian-based Docker image. The image is designed to be minimal, lightweight, and suitable as a base image for your applications.

## Usage

### Pull the Image

You can pull the pre-built image from Docker Hub using the following command:

```bash
docker pull allannava/debian-slim:latest
```

Replace latest with the desired tag if you want a specific version.

### Build the Image
To build the Docker image locally, you can use the following command:

```bash
docker build -t your-image-name:your-tag .
```

Replace your-image-name and your-tag with the desired name and tag for your Docker image.

### Run a Container
Once you have the image, you can run a container using the following:

```bash
docker run -it --rm your-image-name:your-tag
```
Replace your-image-name and your-tag with the actual name and tag you used during the build.

### Customization
Feel free to customize the Dockerfile to include any additional packages or configurations required for your specific use case. Ensure that you understand the impact on image size and functionality.
